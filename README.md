> **TLDR:** Standalone TOML section loader for swe-edge — XDG-aware layered resolution, `{{VAR_NAME}}` substitution with pluggable name policies and value sources, and preflight validation. No runtime dependency.

Standalone, runtime-independent TOML section loader for swe-edge services. Provides
XDG-aware, layered config section loading for any `T: DeserializeOwned + Default`. Library
crates can depend on this crate directly without pulling in `swe-edge-runtime-main`.

The crate lives under [`scm/`](scm/) (the formalized SEA package layout). Full usage
examples, the feature list, and the API surface are documented there — this page is
intentionally a pointer, not a duplicate, so it can't drift out of sync the way it
previously did.
